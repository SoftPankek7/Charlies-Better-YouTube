# Charlies Better YouTube
A bunch of tweaks to make the YT experience better.

I actually use these on my main computers (through TamperMonkey)

---

### What "tweaks" are there?

- Remove Shorts from the homepage
- Remove "Country Code" - the two little letters next to the logo
- Remove Voice Searching
- Removing the annoying "promos" and holiday crap
- Remove the "chips" - little genres on top of the videos
- Hide the email from the profile context menu
- Hide the original name from the profile context menu
- Clean the profile context menu to only show your profile
- Bringing up the profile context menu to make it compact
- Making more elements have the "frosted glass" class
- Making the "frosted glass" look WAY BETTER

That is ``11`` TWEAKS! ***WOW***.

### Known Issues:

1. The chip bar is waaaay too big. I tried fixing that, to no avail. Any fixes would be great.

That is it.

### How to install

It comes as 3 different ways - ***Bookmarklet, User script,*** and ***Extension***

- **If you want to use it through TamperMonkey**, go to releases (or the ```userscript.js``` file) and copy the contents onto a blank user script.

- **If you want to use it as an extension**, you have 2 options:
  
  a) Adding it via the ``.pem``  and ``.crx`` file (which doesnt work for me)

  b) Adding it via ``Unpacked Install``:

  1.  Downloading the ``Extensions`` directory
  2. Going to the ``Extensions`` page ([Edge](edge://extensions/) | [Chrome](chrome://extensions/)) 
  3. Enable developer options if haven't already
  4. Clicking ``Load Unpacked``
  5. Navigating onto the downloaded directory
  6. Installing it

- **If you want to use it as a bookmarklet**, (highly unrecommended),
  
  go to ``bookmarklet.js`` and copy EVERYTHING. 
  Then, go to your ``bookmarks`` ([Edge](edge://favorites/) | [Chrome](chrome://favorites/))
  
  click ``Add Favourite`` - name it whatever
  and paste into the URL box.

  Now, if you want to use it - click the bookmark.
